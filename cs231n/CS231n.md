# KNN
Classify images
density matrix (slow)

> ## Distance

>Manhattan distance  [coordinate dependent]\\
>Euclidean distance\\
>Try both to see which perform better.
> ### Setting hyperparameters

>hyperparameters: cannot learn from algorithm
>split dataset into train, validation, test. 

# Linear classification
[linear decision boundary]

> ## Parametric Approach: linear classifier

>image -> f(x, W) -> 10 numbers giving class scores\\
>`W: parameters or weights` f(x, W) is designed by needs. e.g. easy one: f(x, W) = Wx + b

>dimension of f(x, W) is 10 x 1; and x has dimension of 3072x1 => W has dimension of 10 x 3072; b is bias term
